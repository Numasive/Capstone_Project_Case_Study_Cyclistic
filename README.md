Key tasks, as a checklist.
Deliverable, as a checklist.

### Scenario

The Cyclistic Director of Marketing, Lily Moreno, believes the company's future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, my team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights, my team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. But first, Cyclistic executives must apporove our recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations.

### About the company

In 2016, Cyclistic launched a successful bike-share offering. Since then, the program has grown to a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that are geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system anytime.

Cyclistic's appeal is that they offer flexibility in their pricing plans with single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders. Customers who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members.

Cyclisticâ€™s finance analysts have concluded that annual members are much more profitable than casual riders. Moreno believes there is a very good chance to convert casual riders into members.

Moreno has set a clear goal: Design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members. In order to do that, however, Moreno and her team are interested in analyzing the Cyclistic historical bike trip data to identify trends.
